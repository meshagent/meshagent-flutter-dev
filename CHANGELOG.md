## [0.28.0]
- BREAKING: ToolOutput was renamed to ToolCallOutput, ContentTool.execute now returns ToolCallOutput, and AgentsClient.toolCallResponseContents was removed.
- Tool-call streaming now uses ControlContent close status codes/messages with RoomServerException.statusCode; InvalidToolDataException signals validation failures and closes streams with status 1007.
- Flutter chat UI now reads thread status text/mode attributes, supports steerable threads (sends "steer" messages), and exposes cancel while processing.
